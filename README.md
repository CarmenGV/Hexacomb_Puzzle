# Hexacomb_Puzzle
Code uses recursion to solve the Hexacomb Puzzle. 

The Hexacomb puzzle provides seven hexacombs, each side numbered 1-6. The solution is to connect all seven hexacombs in a flower formation with all touching sides matching in number. The seven hexacombs are fed into the code as an array that contains numbers 1 through 6 in the order they appear on the hexacomb from left to right.
